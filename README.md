# YData backend interview exercise

This project is part of the interview process for our backend position.

If you want to apply to this position, please send your resum√© to [careers@ydata.ai](careers@ydata.ai)

## Tips

* The Makefile contains the required actions to build and generate all the necessary files and code
* This runs asynchronously in a cluster, where logs are important. The project doesn't has a logger in place, neither logs along the important parts. We recommend that you add it.
* Pay attention to the architecture and separation of concerns, we value it.
* Use interfaces when it makes sense (for example, you need to inject something)
